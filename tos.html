                    <br/>
                    Place an order on sale@danishbitweed.trade with the complete address of the location you want to receive the product(s)
                    specifying the product(s) you are interested in and amount you want to buy for (in Bitcoins) and wait
                    for my reply.<br/><br/><b><i>Please notice, additional costs and fees involved in shipping your order will be paid by you and will be calculated before
                    your product is purchased, if you have sent bitcoins insufficient of covering the shipping costs and filling your order, the bitcoins will be
                    returned to the address they were sent from.</i></b>

                    You will receive my reply on your order placement along with the specifics regarding estimated amount(s) of product(s) and the earliest
                    possible shipping-day + estimated time of arrival of your order. To accept the terms and finalize your purchase(s), simply transfer the
                    specified amount of bitcoin to the bitcoin address you will see at the bottom of your order confirmation(email). If the payment arrives later than the earliest
                    possible shipping-day, and up to 1 (one) week after said day, you will be informed of the new estimated time of shipping on email.<br/>Should payment be
                    delayed by more than 1 (one) week then the order will be considered void.<br/><br/><b><i>Estimated percentage of lost products is
                    0.5-2.5% due to postal screening and cross-border deliveries. I advice you to keep orders relatively small in order to ensure the best
                    odds for your package to make it home.<br/>If an order is particularly large, i will make the decision to split it up in smaller portions
                    or deny to fulfill the order, in either case, you will receive notice on email and the payment (if any was made) will be returned to the
                    sending address.</i></b>
