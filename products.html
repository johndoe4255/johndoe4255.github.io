                    <br/>
                    Worst case scenario, the police are at your door asking about a letter addressed to you personally, in which case the only sane response
                    is to shake your head and deny knowledge to any letter. That will leave them with the choice of either confiscating the letter and do nothing
                    or they will try to get a search warrant for your personal properties, which is extremely unlikely based on the fact that you, if guilty, is
                    an obvious end-user and not a manufacturer or dealer.<br/>I cant speak for all countries, but mostly, law enforcement agencies will need to
                    have substantial proof of a transaction, and not just a letter addressed to you, in order to make a case (which mostly ends in a fine)
                    and <b>bitcoin</b> is very helpful in such cases <b>but not bullet-proof</b>. The odds are tiny, but making them even tinier is always a great thing
                    so if you feel like it, you could use a service such as <a style="color:#036013" target="_blank" href="https://bitmixer.io/why.html"><b>bitmixer</b></a>.
                    <br/>Find out more on their website.

                    <i><b>Personal Information</b></i>
                    <br/>
                    Ideally, you provide as <b>incorrect</b> information as possible, while still being able to locate and pick up the letter. There are many ways to
                    achieve such goals. Unfortunately, the procedures tend to vary quite a lot from one country to another so i cannot provide a step-by-step guide
                    applicable to all clients. I can however share a few good practices. Firstly, you should buy/install a reliable VPN to hide your online traces.
                    I recommend <a style="color:#036013" target="_blank" href="https://hide.me/?friend=56c31e02bec26"><b>hide.me</b></a> which has many years in the business and also provides a
                    free proxy service. A VPN should be acquired no matter what, if one is a regular internet-(ab)user, if not for protection
                    against internet surveillance then for reduced risk of entering the sight of a malicious person.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    With a VPN running (or through a proxy) you are now ready to create a throw-away email completely off record. There are an ocean
                    of email providers out there so i wont bother listing any, however, be sure to not forget the login credentials until you are done
                    with it! I also recommend you do not keep the credentials on your computer, or on a piece of paper etc. and if you do, be sure to
                    delete or destroy them when your done with the email address.

                    Marijuana seeds are some of the easiest to care for, especially those from Denmark or other tempered climates.

                    enjoying the benefits of sunlight to the fullest when the chance is there.<br/> The seeds can grow both indoor and outdoor without
                    issues, although a proper grow-setup would make them thrive, they can do just fine sitting in your windows, or in a garden.

                    Pot or Skunk, the names are plentiful and the differences can be hard to spot. Pot is in most cases a lot
                    weaker than skunk is, with THC levels of skunk often tripling that of pot.<br/>In many parts of the world,
                    including the United States and Central America, pot is the most common cannabis product consumed among the
                    general population.<br/><br/>It is also the most common way for medical marijuana patients to medicate themselves, often
                    using a vaporizer, or pipe to smoke from. Pot and skunk can be smoked without mixing it with tobacco, unlike all types of
                    hashish, which makes it ideal for cancer patients etc. where tobacco is best to avoid.<br/><br/>
